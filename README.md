Robust Option Pricing Bounds via Martingale Optimal Transport
## Abstract
This (undergraduate) thesis focuses on robust, model-independent option pricing, a framework that seeks to determine the bounds of option prices without relying on specific probabilistic models of the underlying assets. A key tool in this approach is Martingale Optimal Transport (MOT), which combines martingale theory and optimal transport to derive model-free price bounds based on marginal distributions of asset prices. Building on existing work, this thesis reformulates the dual problem of MOT by leveraging the theory of viscosity solutions, providing a novel mathematical perspective on the problem structure. This reformulation not only enhances theoretical understanding but also facilitates the development of novel numerical algorithms. **A key contribution of this thesis is the introduction of a neural network-based numerical method to solve the reformulated dual problem.** The proposed method approximates the optimal dual solutions in high-dimensional settings, overcoming computational challenges that traditional approaches may face. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methodology, offering a practical tool for robust option pricing in model-independent settings. The results contribute to the growing literature on MOT and reinforce the utility of neural networks in solving complex financial optimization problems.
